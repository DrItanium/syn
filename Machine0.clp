; Machine0.clp - First architecture using the new ucoded techniques
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The machine0 core is a 64-bit signed integer architecture with a 64-bit word
; and a 27-bit memory space. If the addresses are expanded to the byte level then it would
; be a 30-bit memory space!
; This 27 bit memory space is divided up into 8 16 mega word sections!
