0MBEGIN-ENTRY-ROOT
The syn architecture is a tool for constructing simulators out of custom
instruction sets. It is meant to be educational and simple over speed. The
logic for the core is implemented in CLIPS and extra features are exposed from
C++ to make processor/system simulation much easier.

This document is meant to be an online help guide relating to the different
components exposed to CLIPS.

Supported subfields are:

EXTERNAL_ADDRESSES - a sub menu which describes what external address types are
                     exposed.
END-ENTRY

1MBEGIN-ENTRY-EXTERNAL_ADDRESSES
syn uses the external address mechanism of CLIPS to provide concepts and
features which would be difficult or goofy to implement in pure CLIPS.

Supported subtopics are:

MEMORY_BLOCK - Information on the memory block external address type
END-ENTRY

2MBEGIN-ENTRY-MEMORY-BLOCK
The memory block is an allocation of heap storage that can be manipulated
through the CLIPS call interface. It is reclaimed automatically when it goes
out of scope. Each memory cell is the same size as a CLIPSInteger so keep this
in mind when allocating cells

Supported subtopics are:

    CONSTRUCTING - How to construct one
    COMMANDS_MB - List of commands and what they do

3MBEGIN-ENTRY-CONSTRUCTING_MB
Building a memory-block is quite easy, all you need to do is provide it with
the number of memory cells you want to allocate.

Examples:

    (bind ?k (new memory-block 128)) ; Allocate 128 cells worth of space

    (deffunction MAIN::new-block
                 (?size)
                 (new memory-block
                      ?size))
END-ENTRY

3MBEGIN-ENTRY-COMMANDS_MB
The following is a list of commands that the memory-block type will respond to.
This list also can be queried for further information
  type - return the external address type name of this memory block
  size - retrieve the number of cells allocated for this memory-block
  populate - set all cells to the same value
  write - set a given memory cell to a provided value
  read - get the value stored in the provided address
  swap - swap the contents of two addresses
  move - copy the contents from one cell to another
  increment - increment the value in the given memory cell by one
  decrement - decrement the value in the given memory cell by one
END-ENTRY

4IBEGIN-ENTRY-TYPE_MB
-- type

Returns the type of the memory-block. This operation takes in no arguments

Format:

    (call <memory-block> type)
END-ENTRY

4IBEGIN-ENTRY-SIZE_MB
-- size

Returns the number of cells allocated to the memory-block.  This operation
takes in no arguments

Format:

    (call <memory-block> size)

END-ENTRY

4IBEGIN-ENTRY-POPULATE_MB
-- populate

Sets each memory cell to the provided value. This operation is significantly
faster than calling write for each memory cell.

Format:

    (call <memory-block> populate <value>)

Examples:

    (call ?mb populate 32) ; will set each memory cell to the value 32

    (call ?mb populate 0) ; will set each memory cell to zero/clears memory

END-ENTRY

4IBEGIN-ENTRY-READ_MB
-- read

Retrieves the value stored at the given memory cell address. This address is an
offset from the beginning of this memory-block. Extra math will have to be
done if multiple memory-blocks are allocated to make up a memory-space for a
machine. The read operation takes in a single argument, the address to load.

If the address is not in the range of the memory block then an error will be
raised and FALSE will be returned. CLIPS will halt as a result and return to
the REPL.

Format:

    (call <memory-block> read <address>)

Examples:

    (call ?blk read 1) ; read address 1 of the memory-block


END-ENTRY

4IBEGIN-ENTRY-WRITE_MB
-- write

Writes the provided value to the given memory cell address.  This address is an
offset from the beginning of this memory-block. Extra math will have to be
done if multiple memory-blocks are allocated to make up a memory-space for a
machine. The write operation takes in two arguments: the address to write to
and the value to write to that address.

If the address is not in the range of the memory block then an error will be
raised and FALSE will be returned. CLIPS will halt as a result and return to
the REPL.

Format:

    (call <memory-block> write <address> <value>)

Examples:

    (call ?blk write 1 32) ; write 32 to address 1 of the memory-block ?blk

END-ENTRY
