There are 256 word sized general purpose registers. These GPRs can be referenced in multiple
ways. 

1) Whole words (256)
2) Half word (512)
3) Quarter word (1024)
4) characters (2048)

Each of these styles are an overlay over the 256 Word sized GPRS. There are separate instructions
to operate on these different types and very few instructions which interface with different kinds
of styles at the same time. 

Each style has a different encoding width, 

Whole words are represented with eight-bit fields
Half words are represented with nine-bit fields
Quarter words are represented with ten-bit fields
Character fields are represented with 11-bit fields

The whole GPRs are rX with X being an index in the range [0, 255]
The Half words are rXu and rXl with X being an index in the range [0, 255] with 'u' representing the upper half and
    'l' representing the lower half of the word.
The quarter words are rXqY with X being an index in the range [0, 255] and Y being in the range [0, 3]
The character are rXcY where X is an index in the range [0, 255] and Y being in the range [0, 7]

There are alternative representations of the non whole word representations:

For the words, wX with X being [0, 255]
For the half words, hX with X being [0, 511]
For the quarter words, qX with X being [0, 1023]
For the characters, cX with X being [0, 2047]

The registers are referenceable like this to make the memory layout and design easy to do as well as just be 
super convienent. 

Keep in mind that iris64 is not a RISC architecture.
